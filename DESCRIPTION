Title: Population Downscaling Using Areal Interpolation
Version: 0.2.1
Author: Marios Batsaris
Maintainer: Marios Batsaris <m.batsaris@aegean.gr>
Description: Given a 
    set of source zone polygons such as
    census tracts or city blocks alongside with population counts and a 
    target zone of incogruent yet superimposed polygon features (such as
    individual buildings) populR transforms population counts from the 
    former to the latter using Areal Interpolation methods.

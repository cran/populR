Description: Areal interpolation of population data obtained
    by census surveys. Given a set of source zone polygons such as
    census tracts or city blocks alongside with population counts and a 
    target zone of incogruent yet superimposed polygon features (such as
    individual buildings) populR transforms population counts from the 
    former to the latter using Areal Weighted and Volume Weighted 
    Interpolation methods.
